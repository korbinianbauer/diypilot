Access point and client mode are both running as services so we should use systemd-networkd to switch off one service and switch on the other. With its options we are able to do it without rebooting. For reference I use Raspbian Stretch Lite 2019-04-08 full upgraded with sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo reboot done at 2019-04-14.

Setup systemd-networkd
For detailed information look at (1). Here only in short. Execute these commands:

# disable debian networking and dhcpcd
rpi ~$ sudo -Es
rpi ~# systemctl mask networking.service dhcpcd.service
rpi ~# sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces~
rpi ~# sed -i '1i resolvconf=NO' /etc/resolvconf.conf

# enable systemd-networkd
rpi ~# systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service systemd-resolved.service
rpi ~# ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
Setup wpa_supplicant as wifi client with wlan0
Setup wpa_supplicant with this file and your settings and enable it.

rpi ~# cat >/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf <<EOF
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="TestNet"
    psk="verySecretPwassword"
}
EOF

rpi ~# chmod 600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
rpi ~# systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service
rpi ~# systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
Setup wpa_supplicant as access point with ap0
Create this configuration file:

rpi ~# cat > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-ap0.conf <<EOF
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="RPiNet"
    mode=2
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    proto=RSN WPA
    psk="anotherPassword"
    frequency=2412
}
EOF

rpi ~# chmod 600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-ap0.conf
Configure interfaces
Create these two configuration files:

rpi ~# cat > /etc/systemd/network/08-wlan0.network <<EOF
[Match]
Name=wlan0
[Network]
DHCP=yes
EOF

rpi ~# cat > /etc/systemd/network/12-ap0.network <<EOF
[Match]
Name=ap0
[Network]
Address=192.168.4.1/24
DHCPServer=yes
[DHCPServer]
DNS=84.200.69.80 1.1.1.1
EOF
Modify service for access point to use ap0
ap0 is a virtual interface and it must be created and deleted with start/stop of the service. It is also required to modify dependencies. This cannot be done with a drop in file, so we have to modify the full service. In addition this service conflicts with the client connection service with wlan0. We set a dependency Conflicts= so we do not have to care about stopping the other service. Do it with:

rpi ~# systemctl disable wpa_supplicant@ap0.service
rpi ~# systemctl edit --full wpa_supplicant@ap0.service
Modify/insert only these lines: Requires=, After=, Conflicts=, ExecStartPre= and ExecStopPost= as shown. Leave all other untouched, save it and quit the editor:

[Unit]
Description=WPA supplicant daemon (interface-specific version)
Requires=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device
Conflicts=wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
Before=network.target
Wants=network.target

# NetworkManager users will probably want the dbus version instead.

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStartPre=/sbin/iw dev wlan0 interface add ap0 type __ap
ExecStart=/sbin/wpa_supplicant -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-%I.conf -Dnl80211,wext -i%I
ExecStopPost=/sbin/iw dev ap0 del

[Install]
Alias=multi-user.target.wants/wpa_supplicant@%i.service
Now you can determine in which mode the RasPi should start after bootup. Just enable that service and disable the other one. If I want to start with client connection:

rpi ~$ sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
rpi ~$ sudo systemctl disable wpa_supplicant@ap0.service
Reboot.

You should then be able to switch the service with:

rpi ~$ sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant@ap0.service
rpi ~$ sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
No need to stop a service.

If you want to make the pi change between access point and client mode automatically, so that the pi provides an access point only if there is no known SSID nearby, then it isn't possible with this setup. The wpa_supplicant client service must always run so it can detect an available hotspot nearby. You can only switch on/off the access point in addition to the client service. So you have first to setup a Access point as WiFi repeater, optional with bridge or Access point as WiFi repeater with additional WiFi-dongle. Then you could use wpa_cli running as daemon with option -a to detect a connection to a hotspot and switch on/off the access point on the RasPi.
